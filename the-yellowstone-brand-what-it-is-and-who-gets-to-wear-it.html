The bond the Dutton family has to the land, the bonds within the Dutton family themselves, the relationships they form with those closest to them, and even the way they’re connected to those who mean them harm.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>There are some obvious ways to tell who’s bonded in the sleepy Montana town, but some are less obvious. However, it doesn’t make them less essential. The less blatant bonds might be the most important; they certainly carry the most weight.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>If you’ve been paying attention, several characters wear a brand. The Y is widely known as signifying the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, and it’s forever scarred into their skin.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Why do some of the ranch hands wear the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch brand, what does the brand represent, and who is chosen to don it? Let’s take a look.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-what-does-the-yellowstone-brand-represent data-injectable=false>What does the Yellowstone brand represent?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Above all else, the&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;brand stands for trust and honor. To wear the brand, you must first understand its weight, which is as heavy as it is painful. To be branded doesn’t merely permanently burn a mark in your skin; it’s physically traumatizing — and maybe even mentally too — but the ranch hands are willing to embrace it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Being branded is a multistep process, and in part, it gives them a fresh start. The ranch hands at the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch all have scars of their own and stories to tell about them; several of them have come from dark places bringing a light from within and trying to shine despite feeling worn out.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Feeling that almost out-of-body experience is a new page being turned, albeit painful, but it’s new nonetheless. They belong to the ranch now, to one another, and something so much bigger than themselves.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RipJohn.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jimmy.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/johnkayce.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ranchhands.jpeg><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>Of course, for as much as they belong to one another, the brand is a tool Dutton uses to ensure that his ranch hands stay his ranch hands, but there’s more to it than that, and it’s not something that just any Dutton associate receives. As we said, the brand signifies being “owned,” but sometimes that goes far beyond the barbaric way you might imagine it. Sometimes that feeling of belonging to something else is exactly what the ranch hands that come to the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch need most.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>There’s also an understood reverence to wearing the brand that, while never really spoken aloud, still underscores its importance. Those who wear the brand are expected to do anything to protect the Duttons. Yes, that means anything — even taking a life.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Why doesn’t everyone wear the brand?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>Why doesn’t every Dutton ranch hand receive the brand? Well, that’s a loaded question. First and foremost, they must be trusted completely, which is a level of respect that not everyone can receive.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Quite simply, John Dutton has to have the utmost faith that you’d never betray him or the ranch, and sometimes even he gets it wrong. As fans of Yellowstone know, some of the losses in past seasons wore the brand, and they’re easily considered wolves in sheep’s clothing.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Do ranch hands get to voice an opinion in wearing the brand? That’s another loaded question. The choice isn’t one that’s made quickly, but when given the opportunity, there’s not a fight to be had. These ranch hands know the hurt they’ll experience, but they also understand what comes next — the loyalty and the bonded brotherhood for life.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Receiving the brand is an unspoken promise, a forever kind of promise, and breaking it only ends in violence.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Which Yellowstone characters are branded?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>The first time we see someone receive the brand is Jimmy in season 1 at the hands of Rip Wheeler. Rip gives Jimmy a chance, an opportunity, and he takes it. He’s going to work on the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch, and they’ll protect him from that moment on.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Jimmy wasn’t the first to be branded, as we also see Rip reveal the Y on his chest. It’s no surprise that Rip has been branded, as he is John Dutton’s right-hand man. Kayce Dutton, John’s son, also wears the brand, and fans find out more about that in the first season.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>John felt he’d been burned one too many times by his son — betrayed as if there were no options left. He forced Kayce to take the brand in an attempt to remind him where his loyalty should lie. As John explains that the brand also signifies a second chance, it shines a light on the fact that John didn’t hate Kayce — he just wasn’t done with him yet.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Veteran ranch hand and one of Rip and John’s closest friends, Lloyd Pierce, also wears the brand, a show of complete devotion to the ranch. Lloyd is a wise spirit in the mix of the ranch hands, someone who has been around long enough to know what happens when times are good and when they aren’t. He’s versed in the Dutton mannerisms and how they work individually and as a group.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>Walker also took the Yellowstone brand, which his character has struggled with ever since. Walker was brought to the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch after serving time, and it makes sense that he’d take the brand as a second chance and a fresh start — but he hasn’t risen to the occasion to become a favorable ranch hand. Still, he wears the brand, and his loyalty remains to the Duttons.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Ethan,&nbsp;Teeter, Jake, Ryan, and&nbsp;Colby&nbsp;all receive their brand at the end of season three after proving more than willing to do anything to protect one another and honor the Dutton name. Their brands are significant for several reasons, one of which is that a man lost his brand because of an attack he forged against Teeter and Colby.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>Wade Morrow&nbsp;was once a ranch hand for the Yellowstone Dutton Ranch before striking out on his own, which inherently meant going against the Duttons. When it was discovered that the attack on two of the Dutton ranch hands was his work, the Duttons all worked together to get revenge, sweet, sweet revenge. If it wasn’t apparent by now, Wade’s brand was removed, and the process was as unpleasant as you would imagine.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>So the brand in Yellowstone is a promise, unbreakable and strong — and only some ranch hands are ever allowed to make it. Painful and life-changing, it’s a decision not to be taken lightly, but it comes with the ultimate reward — Dutton-level protection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGaxlaG5sMPSraannV2Xv6K6w2auoZmkYra1ecisZJqmlGLEqbuMoJytq12pvG7DxJqpZqGkZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lenovo-thinkpad-edge-13-not-your-fathers-thinkpad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ThinkPad Edge 13: LCD Analysis">&larr;
