She is not only the most beautiful woman in his eyes but also the star athlete's biggest fan.</p><p class=dh>Kendra Randle, born in a small town in Kentucky, Texas, has been married to New York Knicks star Julius Randle for five years. Blessed with an entrepreneurial spirit, Kendra's achievements are on par with those of her famous husband.</p><p class=dh>She is a businesswoman and founder of Kalore, a fashion brand she built in New York. A master multitasker, Kendra successfully balances motherhood and career while being a devoted fan of her NBA player husband.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Kendra Randle Is Julius's Long-Time Love and College Sweetheart</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Since they were in college, Julius has loved and been in love with Kendra. Julius said he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-julius-randle-20180324-story.html>first met</a> Kendra at a birthday party at the University of Kentucky. He had already decided that she was the woman for him. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-julius-randle-20180324-story.html>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"As soon as we started hanging out, I knew that was my girl."</p><p class=dh>After getting to know each other at the party, they started dating and became a couple. It was Kendra's first time dating a basketball player, and she described Julius as "sincere and sweet."</p><p class=dh>Kendra eventually moved to California with Julius, and the couple continued to enjoy a blissful romance. As time passed, the NBA star decided to elevate their relationship to the next level.</p><p class=dh>In June 2016, Julius proposed to his college sweetheart one evening in Santorini, Greece. Kendra <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BG63p54lpbC/>announced</a> on Instagram that being engaged to the basketball athlete was the "best night" of her life.</p><p class=dh>The <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://natfluence.com/interview/kendra-randle-founder-ceo-kalore/>stylish entrepreneur</a> said she couldn't describe how she felt then. She noted that Julius was the best thing that had ever happened to her, and she thanked him for making her the happiest woman in the world.</p><p class=dh>The couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.weddingstylemagazine.com/wedding-ideas/real-weddings/kendra-shaw-and-julius-randle>tied the knot</a> in August 2017 at The Resort at Pelican Hill in New Port Coast, California, in a ceremony overlooking the ocean. The pair's close friends and family members attended the lavish wedding.</p><p class=dh>Kendra and Julius share two children in the family. They <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BOYXKnSA-fo/>welcomed</a> their oldest son, Kyden Jay Randle, in December 2016, while their younger child, Jayce, was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://sny.tv/articles/knicks-julius-randle-welcoming-new-son-jayce>born</a> in September 2021.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Meanwhile, Kyden was heartbroken when his dad lost to the Brooklyn Nets and never tried to hide his feelings after watching the game.</strong></h3><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Julius Randle's Family Are His Hardest Fans</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Fans' reactions to basketball games can range from excitement to disappointment, and because of this, Kendra has become Julius' number one fan and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://heavy.com/sports/new-york-knicks/julius-randles-wife-rips-knicks-fans-save-your-bs-sympathy/>supporter</a>. Fans were recently unhappy with how he played for the New York Knicks against Brooklyn Nets.</p><p class=dh>Fans even compared Julius's performance to Russell Westbrook's failure with the Los Angeles Lakers. Nina, Russell's wife, reportedly went on a Twitter rant about how they received death threats after a game.</p><p class=dh>Nina's statement was supported by CP "The Franchise," the creator of Knicks Fan TV on Twitter. The user asked that fans keep their comments focused on the game and excluded the families of the NBA stars involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a6763f4b554873ef620b6b18c4f53563.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Julius Randle of the New York Knicks faces James Johnson of the Brooklyn Nets during the second half at Barclays Center on March 13, 2022, in Brooklyn, New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>However, Kendra reacted to CP's comment with frustration and went on to defend Julius. The <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/kendrarandle_/?hl=en">Kalore CEO</a> mentioned how they create a negative narrative and try to pit players against each other.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Kyden was heartbroken when his dad lost to the Brooklyn Nets and never tried to hide his feelings after watching the game. A <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNT3WZaAoj8/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=99891b50-032b-4334-bdc9-73ccd005fe95">video</a> of the boy showed him crying and expressing hate for the athletes who defeated his dad.</p><p class=dh>Kendra was heard in the video telling her son that it was "okay" that <a class="me a" href=#>Julius Randle</a> got lost because it was just a game. Another <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/julius-randles-5-year-old-son-kyden-sobs-after/>clip</a> found him crying after his dad lost to the Indiana Pacers in a preseason game.</p><p class=dh>Kendra consoled her son, assuring him that his father still had a chance to win the game. Some fans felt sorry for the boy, while others admired him for being Julius's biggest and most dedicated fan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcWlibXqrwcuirKxlopa7pbjErGSwoZaaeqmt0maZnp2eYq%2B6eceiqmarmZmyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./signification-de-ghetto-type-broad-par-project-pat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Signification de Ghetto Type Broad par Project Pat">&larr;
