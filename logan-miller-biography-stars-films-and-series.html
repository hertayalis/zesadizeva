Simon, I’m in the Band, The Stanford Prison Experiment, A Dog’s Purpose, Growing Up Fisher,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The walking dead.</span></p><p><span>Miller has warmed his way into the hearts of millions of film viewers around the world, impressing with his acting talent and charisma.&nbsp;He’s one of the rising stars in the industry, and if all goes well, he might one day find

unclear if he finished college or what he studied.&nbsp;Personally, Logan is not yet married, and he has managed to keep his past relationships a secret.&nbsp;Perhaps he prefers to keep his relationship life private since every other aspect of his life is played out in front of cameras and screens.</span></p><p><span>The Colorado native was previously in a relationship with Elizabeth Gillies in 2011, although it was an open affair and it wasn’t very long before they went their separate ways.&nbsp;After that, Logan dated Caitlyn Taylor Love for a while, but that relationship also

Benjamin.&nbsp;He also landed starring roles as Kent McFuller in&nbsp;</span><span>Before I</span><span>&nbsp;Fall and Collin Croyle in&nbsp;</span><span>The Scent of Rain and
