Continue reading to learn more about his family.</strong></p><p>Damien Harris is a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the Buffalo Bills. In college, he played football at Alabama. Furthermore, Harris began his NFL career after being selected by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2019 NFL Draft.</p><p>He was a Patriots player until 2022, when he signed a one-year contract with the Buffalo Bills on March 21, 2023. Harris is making headlines after suffering a neck injury during Sunday’s game against the New York Giants. As a result, many of Damien’s admirers and followers are concerned about his personal life.</p><h2><span id=Does_Damien_Harris_Have_a_Brother>Does Damien Harris Have a Brother?</span></h2><p>Damien Harris, the Buffalo Bills’ running back, is an only child. There is no information on if the football player has a brother or sister. Damien appears to be his parents’ child, as he has two sisters, the names of whom are unknown. Several internet users, however, were baffled, believing Damien had a sibling named Najee Harris.</p><p>The confusion arose because they shared surnames. Not only that, but they work in the same industry, which has led some to believe Damien and Najee are brothers. They are said to be attending the University of Alabama together. Whatever the case may be, Damien and Najee are not brothers. Not to add that Najee plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL).</p><h2><span id=Examine_Damien_Harriss_Family_Life>Examine Damien Harris’s Family Life</span></h2><p>Damien Harris was born in Richmond, Kentucky, on February 11, 1997. Lynn Harris, his mother, has supported him since the beginning of his career. Meanwhile, his father’s name is not publicly available. Damien’s father and mother appear to have divorced a long time ago based on his absence from the family’s existence. Damien once mentioned his mother’s generosity to the family. Damien stated that he was forced to care for his family at a young age. Lynn, without a doubt, gets a lot of credit for Damien’s great career.</p><h2><span id=Damien_Harris_Ethnicity_And_Religion>Damien Harris’ Ethnicity And Religion</span></h2><p>Damien Harris is of African-American descent. Since his birth in Richmond, Kentucky, he has been an American citizen. Furthermore, Harris appears to be a Christian. When he was younger, he used to jump from the wooden pew inside Goodloe’s Chapel Baptist Church.</p><p>Furthermore, in several interviews, Harris discussed his early life, indicating that he had a rough upbringing as the son of a single mother. Harris, however, was interested in athletics and hoped to be a football player. Harris attended Madison Southern High School in Berea, Kentucky. Later, Harris turned down scholarship offers from other colleges to play for the University of Alabama.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
