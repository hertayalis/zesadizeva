And, drumroll please… here’s what I made! It’s a big green, veggie potato pizza loaded with chopped asparagus, asparagus ribbons, cheese, flowering thyme, chives, and those pretty chive blossoms that I got at Chicago’s Logan Square Farmers Market. It’s spring on a plate… or rather, spring on dough. I know I say this all the time, but I LOVE letting local produce lead my meal planning. These fresh impromptu meals just really make…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The farmers market is my happy place for meal inspiration. When I feel really stuck in a cooking rut, I head to local weekend markets. Collecting fresh seasonal produce always helps me combine flavors in interesting ways (what grows together goes together), BUT it can be a little daunting to think on the fly at the market… especially if your goal is to come out with the ingredients to make that night’s meal. In the past, I’ve written about stocking up on produce and making a cooking plan for the week, but this time I’m going to focus on one…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>We sold our&nbsp;house yesterday.&nbsp;In case you haven’t heard, Jack and I are moving(!?), and lately I’ve been feeling a really mixed bag of emotions about it. We left Austin a few weeks ago and are spending the summer temporarily in Chicago (living with my parents – so glamorous!) until we find a new place to call home. We’re&nbsp;excited for a new adventure, but of course, it’s always sad leaving homes and friends (and kitchens! aahh, what am I doing!) behind. Don’t worry, the blog isn’t going anywhere – I have tons of new recipes and other special projects in the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Every so often,&nbsp;I get on these mean green daily smoothie kicks that, in all honesty, can get a little TOO green over time. The kick starts with&nbsp;delicious well-balanced smoothies, but as the days go on, I&nbsp;start cutting corners. I add too much liquid so that the blender will blend fast, leaving me with a watery smoothie. And speaking of water, that’s what I use when I run out of almond milk. I add ice in the name of “thickness,” and I start skipping all ingredients that actually add flavor. What I (we) are left with to drink first thing in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There’s a vegan restaurant that we love in Chicago called The Chicago Diner. Jack and I make it a point to stop there nearly every time we’re in town. The food is really good, but the thing to get there&nbsp;is the vegan milkshake – the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake to be exact.&nbsp;And yes, it’s as decadent as it sounds. A&nbsp;few weeks ago, we ate lunch there and I tried&nbsp;to not order one. Then Jack’s shake came to the table and I&nbsp;said, “I’ll just have one little sip…&nbsp;ok, well maybe just one more…”&nbsp;and before I had stolen&nbsp;nearly his…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Long Weekend! Jack and I are off to the farmers market this morning but I wanted to pop in quickly and share this sangria recipe. I posted it on Instagram awhile back – but I think it’s&nbsp;such a&nbsp;refreshing cocktail&nbsp;for weekend BBQ’s that I wanted to share it here on the blog as well. This combines two of my favorite things in the world – iced tea and wine! Its simple to make – just pour the wine and iced tea into a large pitcher and add the fruit. Chill overnight, so that the flavors will infuse, and serve it…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Lately, Jack and I have been spending a lot of time with my family in Chicago. One thing my husband especially loves about this area is all the comfort food, especially the plethora of meaty things between bread. I often shy away from the “fake meat” types of things, but when I do make something that is inspired by a meat dish, he’s the first to tell me if it’s great or if I’ve missed the mark. Well, I fed these vegan meatballs to him and my family last night, and not only did Jack wolf his down with approval,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Memorial Day is coming up next weekend!&nbsp;Whether you’re hosting a gathering or simply bringing a side dish (hi, I’m Jeanine – the family salad maker), here are a few veggie-ful party recipe ideas. Click on the links or directly on the photos to go to the recipes: First up: Instead of meticulously assembling appetizers, you can set out a bunch of ingredients for this&nbsp;Mix & Match Crostini Bar&nbsp;so your guests can assemble their own toppings. Include some gluten free crackers and at least one&nbsp;vegan spread (like the vegan pesto shown above) and you’ll have all of your bases covered. It’s…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>If you asked everyone in Austin where they get their favorite breakfast tacos, you’d get a different answer from every person. Austinites have opinions about breakfast tacos like Chicagoans have opinions about pizza. When I lived in Austin, I ate more breakfast tacos than I could ever begin to count. Most I loved (some I didn’t), but after sampling them all over town, I learned that my favorite place to get breakfast tacos…is at home. This breakfast tacos recipe is my favorite way to start the day.&nbsp;It features an egg scramble made with pico de gallo and cheddar cheese, plus…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ok, guys, get ready: you’re going to fall in love with these peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. Let me tell you why: This peanut butter cookie recipe comes together in one bowl, it uses 6 ingredients, and it results in decadent, soft, pillowy cookies that are lightly crisp on the outside. These little guys are flourless, and they’re sweetened with coconut sugar, so they’re secretly on the healthy side too. This peanut butter cookie recipe comes from my friend Kathryne’s new book&nbsp;Love Real Food. Her blog,&nbsp;Cookie and Kate, is one of my favorite vegetarian blogs to read, and she is…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you caught last week’s post about my CSA box tips, you might recognize some of those ingredients here in this recipe. What I love most about my “surprise” Farmhouse box is that it&nbsp;inspires me to come up with flavor combinations that I would not have thought of otherwise. Blueberries and fennel?? Yes, it works! The saying is true – what grows together goes together. These were the first blueberries of the season, and I knew I wanted to make a simple recipe to really highlight them. This flatbread is so easy to make and I think it’d be such…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfpa6osY5xcGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gemma-chan-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gemma Chan Net Worth 2024">&larr;
