She is best known for her appearance on the VH1 show “Basketball Wives”, which follows the lives of women who are married to or have dated professional basketball players. She is also the ex-wife of former NFL player Chad Johnson, and the ex-fiancée of former NBA player Antoine Walker. But how did Evelyn Lozada go from being a secretary to a millionaire? And what is Evelyn Lozada’s net worth as of October 2023?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></p><p>Evelyn Lozada was born on December 10, 1975, in Brooklyn, New York. She is of Puerto Rican descent and was raised by her mother and her sister in the Bronx. She attended John F. Kennedy High School, but dropped out at the age of 17. She later earned her GED.</p><p>Lozada moved to Miami in 2007, where she worked as a secretary for an entertainment attorney. She also became the co-owner of Dulce, a shoe boutique in Coral Gables, Florida. She met Antoine Walker, a former NBA player, in 1998, and they started dating. They got engaged in 2005, but broke up in 2008 after Walker filed for bankruptcy.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Rise to Fame and Fortune</strong></h3><p>In 2010, Lozada was cast as one of the original members of the VH1 reality show “Basketball Wives”, along with Shaunie O’Neal, Jennifer Williams, Royce Reed, Suzie Ketcham, and Gloria Govan. The show was a huge hit, attracting millions of viewers and making Lozada a household name. She became known for her fiery personality, her feuds with other cast members, and her lavish lifestyle.</p><p>Lozada also started dating Chad Johnson, a former NFL player, in 2010. They got engaged in 2011 and married in 2012. However, their marriage was short-lived, as they divorced later that year after Johnson was arrested for domestic violence against Lozada. Their planned spin-off show “Ev and Ocho” was canceled by VH1.</p><p>Lozada continued to star on “Basketball Wives” until 2013, when she left the show after the fifth season. She then appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network show “Iyanla: Fix My Life”, where she sought emotional healing with life coach Iyanla Vanzant. She also wrote her first novel with Courtney Parker, titled “The Wives Association: Inner Circle”, which was published by Cash Money Content in 2012.</p><p>In 2014, Lozada gave birth to her second child, Carl Leo Crawford Jr., with Carl Crawford, a former MLB player. They got engaged later that year, but split up in 2017. Lozada returned to “Basketball Wives” in 2017 for the sixth season and has been on the show ever since. She also starred with her daughter Shaniece Hairston on the reality show “Livin’ Lozada” in 2015.</p><p>Lozada has also ventured into other businesses and projects. She launched her own cosmetics line called E by Evelyn Cosmetics in 2012. She also released her second novel with Holly Lorincz, titled “The Perfect Date”, in 2019. She is set to release her third novel with Lorincz, titled “The Wrong Mr. Darcy”, in 2020.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Evelyn Lozada Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Evelyn Lozada has a net worth of $4 million as of October 2023. This is based on her earnings from her reality TV shows, books, endorsements, and other ventures. Lozada has also appeared in various advertisements and commercials for brands such as Pepsi, PETA, Zico Coconut Water, YouthH2O, and more.</p><p>Evelyn Lozada is one of the most successful and influential women in the entertainment industry. She has overcome many challenges and hardships in her life and has turned them into opportunities and achievements. She has also used her fame and fortune to support various charitable causes and organizations. She is a role model for many aspiring entrepreneurs and authors who want to follow their dreams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmsOmuNinZKWnqpaxonnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5x6iuZquYmnqjwcilq2aglad6prnPoqmeZZanvK550Z6YpaGkrnq1woytpmaan6S4tHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-luchetta-wiki-who-are-her-parents-age-and-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Luchetta Wiki | Who Are Her Parents | Age And Relationship">&larr;
