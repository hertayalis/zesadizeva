The indie horror filmmaker seemingly enjoys disturbing his audiences, typically by highlighting family drama rooted in trauma and grief. As his filmography grows, the domestic trauma only gets more alarming.</p><p>OK, we know what you're thinking: Is this recurring theme of family trauma due to personal experience? No, and as it turns out, Ari Aster actually has a great relationship with his family! With that said, keep reading to learn more about his parents and younger brother.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ari Aster has an "amazing relationship" with his parents.</h2><p>On July 15, 1986, Ari Aster was born into a Jewish family in New York City; he's the son of a jazz musician father and a poet (and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cancer survivor</a>) mother named Bobbi Lurie. Not much is known about his parents, but in 2018, Ari opened up about the relationship between him and his family.</p><p>"I will say, I have an amazing relationship with my parents and with my younger brother. I have incredibly supportive parents who are both artists," Ari told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vox</a>. "One reason I'm able to work on as dark a register as I often do is because I've never been made to question anything I was making by them. They were always incredibly supportive."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wanna know what kind of relationship Ari Aster had with his parents and family bc this man’s films and shorts always have the strangest relationships with parents</p>— Ponyboy (@TaquitoTheTito) <a href=#>January 10, 2023</a></figure><p>Ari did note that there's been "a lot of suffering in my family," but said he couldn't really talk about it. "It didn't befall me, but it's befallen people that I care very deeply about."</p><p>However, the filmmaker later revealed that he took inspiration from his family's suffering to make Hereditary: "Things had gotten so relentlessly awful that the feeling prevailed that we basically must be cursed," Ari told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IANS</a>. "I'm always writing from a personal place, but I also love the genre."</p><p>"I'd never want to baldly dramatize any of the sufferings that I or my family had gone through, so by taking the idea of a family being cursed and then literalizing that, I was able to put a lot of those feelings through a horror movie filter, where the canvas demands a high level of catharsis," Ari added.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ari Aster has one sibling: A younger brother.</h2><p>Like his parents, not much is publicly known about Ari's younger brother, including his name. However, the filmmaker spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indie Wire</a> in June 2018 and said he "often felt responsible" for his brother. Ari didn't elaborate further, but a trip to the Ari Aster subreddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that his brother is on the autism spectrum.</p><p>Their mother, Bobbi, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published a piece</a> about her youngest son's autism — she wrote, "... my son cannot comprehend human cruelty. It makes no sense to him." She also mentioned that he was fighting severe anorexia and had Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Foundation</a></figure><p>Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayo Clinic</a>, Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a "rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It's usually a reaction to medication that starts with flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful rash that spreads and blisters. Then the top layer of affected skin dies, sheds, and begins to heal after several days."</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another piece</a>, Bobbi explained how the autoimmune disorder affects her youngest son's eyes: "His left eye went blind; the right eye is constantly exposed to infection; his eyes can no longer make tears," she penned, "the disease process continues, forever; blood vessels growing into the cornea can easily blind his only eye."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BqecCsq56qXaWus7HNrao%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-andrew-tate-dead-or-alive-where-is-he-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Andrew Tate Dead Or Alive?
