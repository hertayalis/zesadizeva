In April of this year, he was given a prison term of at least 23 years.</strong></p><p>In 1987, Roxanne Wood’s husband Terry Wood discovered her lifeless on the kitchen floor of their home. Police said that Terry discovered Roxanne with her neck cut and covered with blood.</p><p>Terry has been a suspect in the death of his spouse for the past 35 years. Although Niles and Michigan State Police officers ruled Roxanne’s death a homicide, there wasn’t enough evidence to make an arrest.</p><p>Investigators finally closed the investigation after more than three decades and detained the defendant, Patrick Gilham, in February of this year.</p><p>A minuscule DNA sample the size of a single cell let investigators identify the culprit. The case’s history and most recent updates are shown here.</p><h2>Update on the murder of Roxanne Wood’s killer, Patrick Gilham</h2><p>35 years after Roxanne Wood’s passing, Patrick Gilham, 67, was detained on February 17, 2022, and charged with second-degree murder.</p><p>According to reports, he was charged with breaking into an occupied home. Patrick Gilhma was given a minimum of twenty-three years in jail on April 25, 2022, after entering a no-contest plea to second-degree murder.</p><p>According to the authorities, the matter was looked into for many years, and investigators from the Michigan State Police went back to it in 2001 and 2020.</p><p>Students from Western Michigan University’s Cold Case Program ultimately helped those detectives locate Gilham on their first case together.</p><p>The students arranged mountains of evidence, including several case files and digital Post-it notes.</p><h2>Patrick Gilham underwent extensive DNA surveillance</h2><p>After Patrick Gilham was identified as a suspect, undercover state police troopers questioned him twice and conducted a thorough surveillance operation on him. Detectives gathered the smoke he had thrown away during that time.</p><p>The DNA from the cigarette was then utilized by the authorities to establish that the DNA found at the crime scene belonged to Gilham, according to Michigan State Police Detective First Lt. Charles Christensen.</p><p>Patrick Gilham was questioned for five hours following his arrest in February, only a few days before the murder’s 35th anniversary.</p><p>Patrick Gilham was questioned by police for five hours and was asked why his DNA was discovered at the location. The accused, though, insisted he had no idea and couldn’t recall anything.</p><p>Colleen Fitzpatrick, the president of the company, called it their biggest technological challenge. He stated that it demonstrates the importance of never losing hope and thanked the Michigan State Police for having trust in them.</p><p>Dark Past Of Roxanne Wood’s Murderer According to The Sun, Patrick Gilham was named as a suspect by genetics specialist Gabriella Vargas using the gnat’s eyebrow of DNA.</p><p>She created a DNA profile that identified the attacker’s race and ancestry. Vargar’s discovery was uploaded by the investigator to an internet DNA database, enabling her to identify prospective relatives.</p><p>The expert eventually constructed the killer’s family tree and located Gilham’s parents. Vargas proposed that one of their three boys may have killed Roxanne.</p><p>The police conducted a comprehensive investigation into the family of Gilham’s three boys before coming upon Gilham’s record.</p><p>Patrick Gilham had a criminal background and had previously served time in jail for unlawful and unusual behavior.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Maxwell Bradley Garrett, Ceren Alkac, and Camaron Engel."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":66}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/maxwell-bradley-garrett/"}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ceren-alkac/"}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":"https://popularbio.com/camaron-engels/"}{"1":66}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Camaron Engel</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>killer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Adama Traore | Parents Fatoumata And Baba, Moha Traoré</a></h3>Who are the parents of Adama Traore?
