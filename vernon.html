Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Vernon has been a member of the Seventeen project for some years and has accumulated substantial wealth from performing, selling albums and singles, and signing multiple commercial contracts. Vernon’s monthly earnings might reach $84,000, with a yearly income of up to <strong>$1 million</strong> as of 2022, according to some reports. Vernon’s band is continually creating new records and performing across the world, thus his net worth of well over a million dollars will only increase. His solo project also earns him extra money, however, no particular amounts are revealed.</p><h2><span id=Vernon-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Vernon- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Vernon Chwe was born in New York, USA, on February 18, 1998. He has a 23-year-old son. Because his name is spelled differently in different languages, his full name in Korean is Choi Hansol, yet he goes as Vernon because he utilizes his middle name as his stage name. He revealed that his mother’s maiden name was “Vernon,” but he liked it so much that he adopted it. Melody Chwe, his mother, is an art teacher from the United States. Simon Choi is his father’s name, and he is both a Korean and a teacher. Vernon’s younger sister, Sofia Chwe (Choi Hangyeol), posed for a children’s clothing line when she was about six years old.</p><p>She is a high school student who appreciates singing as a hobby. Vernon’s admirers watch her success and show their respect and support by providing nice comments on her performance videos. Vernon has a temporary tattoo of his sister’s name on one of his arms.</p><p>Vernon’s family lived in New York for several years until being forced to relocate to South Korea when Vernon was five years old, to Hongdae, a neighborhood in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, due to familial circumstances that have not been revealed. His mother was compelled to stay at home for an extended period of time since she did not speak Korean and was unable to find work in Seoul. Vernon is fluent in both English and Korean because they all spoke English at home.</p><p>Vernon began his education at a local elementary school before transferring to Ewha University Elementary School, which his parents selected for him, and subsequently Changchun Middle School. There is no information available on which college or university Vernon is presently attending or has graduated from; it appears that he is now focused on his career and has placed his schooling on hold. Vernon resides in Gangnam because that is where Seventeen’s house is. His family is still in Hongdae.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table id=tablepress-824 class="tablepress tablepress-id-824" style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody class=row-hover><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Real Name</strong></td><td class=column-2><strong>Hansol Vernon Chwe</strong></td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Profession</strong></td><td class=column-2>Singer</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td class=column-2>18 February 1998</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>23 year old</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td class=column-2>New York, USA</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td class=column-2>Hansol Vernon Chwe</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Star Sign</strong></td><td class=column-2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr class="row-8 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Mother</strong></td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr><tr class="row-9 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td class=column-2>Unmarried</td></tr><tr class="row-10 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td class=column-2>$1 million</td></tr><tr class="row-11 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td class=column-2>American</td></tr><tr class="row-12 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td class=column-2>White</td></tr><tr class="row-13 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Height</strong></td><td class=column-2>5 feet 10 inches</td></tr><tr class="row-14 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Weight</strong></td><td class=column-2>62 Kg</td></tr><tr class="row-15 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td class=column-2>Light Brown</td></tr><tr class="row-16 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td class=column-2>Blonde</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Vernon-_Relationship_Girlfriend>Vernon- Relationship, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Vernon is usually surrounded by girls, but he is lonely at the moment. He had a girlfriend when he was 14 years old in 2012, but they kept their connection hidden. As a result, they had a violent quarrel after his ex-girlfriend shared some of their private chats on social media after they split up.</p><h2><span id=Vernon-_Professional_Career>Vernon- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Pledis Entertainment, a reputable firm started in 2007 by Han Sung-Soo, debuted “Seventeen TV,” an internet program streamed on the UStream platform, in 2013. The show ran multiple seasons and was similar to X-Factor and other shows in which a huge number of trainees learn singing, dancing, and performance, culminating in a concert in which they all display what they’ve learned thus far.</p><p>Vernon was one of the characters who caught the attention of the viewers from the first few episodes of the show. The show’s agents are claimed to have observed Vernon visiting his school near a metro stop. He was cast right there, at the age of 14, with an invitation to the project.</p><p>The concept had its television premiere in 2015 with a one-hour show dubbed “Big Debut Plan,” which was a big success.<br>A few days later, they released their first EP, “17 Carat,” which immediately became the longest-charting album in the K-pop genre in the United States. They released another EP named “Boys Be” in September 2015, which was a tremendous hit with enthusiastic fans all over the world waiting for it, and it won multiple accolades including “Seoul Music Awards,” “Golden Disk Awards,” and “Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards.”</p><p>Seventeen launched their first full-length studio album, “Love & Letter,” in 2016 and went on a world tour to promote it, stopping in South Korea, Singapore, Japan, China, and lastly Australia. They released their third EP, “Going Seventeen,” in December 2016, and it outsold their studio album “Love&Letter” despite no one expecting it to. They released their fourth EP, “Al1,” in 2017, and then went on another world tour, “Diamond Edge,” hitting North America and many Asian nations.</p><p>In 2018, Seventeen released a special album named “Director’s Cut,” as well as their debut Japanese album “We Make You” and fifth EP “You Make My Day.” The year 2019 started with the publication of their sixth EP, “You Made My Dawn” — the single “Home” from that EP shattered all records and won about 10 prizes on weekly music shows.</p><p>J.Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and T.I. are among Vernon’s favorite rap musicians. Among female vocalists, he prefers Nicki Minaj, however he confesses he doesn’t have a favorite girl band. Vernon enjoys Hip Hop, Rap, and R&B music. Nobody would think it, but Vernon occasionally listens to classical jazz. Vernon is an older vocalist that admires David Bowie and cherishes his contributions to pop music and music culture in general. Vernon admires rapper J Cole, as well as other American musicians. He considers him to be a wonderful artist and desires to be like him.</p><p>Vernon famously quipped that he preferred to listen to music rather than eat. If he could, Vernon would serenade his girlfriend with John Legend’s “Stay With You.”</p><p>He prefers to watch movies rather than read, and his favorites are “Cloud Atlas” and “Fight Club.” Leonardo DiCaprio (to whom Vernon is usually likened due to some physical resemblance), Johnny Depp, and Brad Pitt are among his favorite actors. He likes to read webcomics.</p><p>Vernon is attracted by all things relating to fashion, and he is utterly infatuated with his hat collection.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Vernon has light-brown hair that he routinely colors blonde and lighter tones; he also has light-brown eyes. Vernon stands <strong>5ft 10ins (1.78 m)</strong> tall and weighs approximately <strong>136lbs (62 kgs)</strong>. Vernon leads a very active lifestyle, dancing and training frequently, thus his body is in good shape, albeit no precise vital statistics for Vernon can be located.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Notyourgothgirlfriend</a>, <a href=#>Medukarabu</a>, and <a href=#>Lili Sixx</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Paul Delvaux</a></h3>Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Paul Delvaux's Estimated Net Worth, Age, Biography, Career, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki.
