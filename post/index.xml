What may be the biggest crime about HP's EliteBook 8460p is that for how attractive the rest of the notebook is, the screen is quite terrible. While I appreciate the matte finish, this screen is easily the third worst I've ever tested personally, behind the Gateway ID49C's awful color and my own Lenovo ThinkPad X100e's absolutely dire matte panel.

More bad news: the glossy screen and the standard 1366x768 WXGA resolution are mandatory in the Edge. There is no matte finish available, and while the 768p HD screen is not bad, a higher resolution option would have been appreciated, especially on a machine with business-class pretensions.

The static superheat may be adjusted by turning the valve’s setting stem. Turning the valve clockwise increases static superheat and, as a result, lowers the amount of refrigerant that flows through it. Reducing static superheat and increasing refrigerant flow are achieved by rotating the compressor counterclockwise.
As a result, one would wonder whether a Txv can be modified in any way. The TXV is a modulating valve, which means that it cannot be changed open or closed.</description></item><item><title>HP Envy vs. Pavilion: Which is best?</title><link>/hp-envy-vs-pavilion-which-is-best.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hp-envy-vs-pavilion-which-is-best.html</guid><description>Shopping for an HP laptop might seem daunting at first, as HP has a lot of different models to pick from.
